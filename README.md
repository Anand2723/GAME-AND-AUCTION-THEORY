# GAME-AND-AUCTION-THEORY
# Preface 
In this project, we have developed two new games based on auction and game theory and performed live experimentation, collected data and performed a detailed analysis on it.
This detailed study included human psychology, game theory mathematics and deviations from theoretical data which we found on practical experimentation.
The link to the spreadsheet of collected datasets can be easily found in the pdf file.
# Motive 
The major motive to perform this project was to learn about game theory mathematics and how does a human brain functions while playing any game. 
This subject fascinated me a lot as I started studying it which became the major driving force behind completing this project.
# Results 
Our detailed study showed that there were some similarities and some deviations from the theoretical data which might be a result of small sample size. 
From this project, we can also conclude that different humans think differently in the same situation and use different strategies to win the game and there can be several reasons behind it.
